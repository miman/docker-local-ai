## N8N

N8N is a workflow automation platform whre you visually can create AI solutions and automate tasks.

More information can be found here: https://n8n.io/

After installation you can run the N8N Web UI here: [localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)

The config for this web app will be placed on a separate Docker volume called **_n8n_data_**, so they are kept even if you delete the container & reinstalls a newer version.
