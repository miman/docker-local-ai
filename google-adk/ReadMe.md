# Google ADK test app

This folder contains some Google ADK (Agent Developer Kit) projects for testing purposes.

Some of the projects are run ni the web mode and the mcp_agent project is run using the run.sh file in that folder.

## weather_agent
This app will just return the weather (hardcoded) using a ADK tool

Test query: **what is the weather in new york**


## mcp_agent
This app will use an MCP server to list all files in this folder.
Just to exemplify how to use MCP with ADK


## Start the app

run 

```
adk web
```
