## Bolt.diy

Bolt.diy is an open source tool for developers to Prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack web apps.

More information can be found here: https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy

After installation you can run the Bolt.diy Web UI here: [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

Version **_v0.0.6_** of Bolt.diy will be used, if there is a newer version you need to update the version in the install script.

The .env file that is used in the Bolt docker-compose is automatically updated with the docker host URL to Ollama, so it should work out of the box.
