Execute run.bat & go to this URL: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/thread?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024

You will need to replace the IP address in the run file '**http://192.168.68.130:11434/**' with the address to the IP address for the server that runs your Ollama server

Obs, the run file will run the agent in Docker but not install a server there so when you close the process it will not be visible in Docker any longer
